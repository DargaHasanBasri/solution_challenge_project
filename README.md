# HelpMed :earth_africa:	


We developed this project to provide treatment for patients who cannot receive treatment due to impossibilities. Our goal is to make the voice of the unheard heard around the world and provide equal treatment opportunities to everyone.

Firstly, we wanted to raise awareness among users by adding informative sections. Our application consists of two parts: organization or user login. When an organization login is made, help can be called to the whole world for the needed region with clear figures and in a reliable way. In the user login section, donations can be made to regions in need or volunteers can go to the region to help according to the need.

The registration and forgot password pages were designed for easy use.

On the main page, we can view all the help announcements in detail by clicking on the "View All" button.

We can easily make donations according to the needs of the announcement we choose.

Thanks to the integration with Google Maps, we can view the help area up close.

If we have made an organization login, we can quickly raise funds by sharing posts for the needs of the help area.
